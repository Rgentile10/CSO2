I used O2 optimization and ran my program on portal which will affect timings:

For Scenario 1 with an Empty Function Call:
Number of Test Iterations: 1,000
Average time: 79 ns 

For Scenario 2 with getppid System Call
Number of Test Iterations: 1,000
Average time: 412 ns

For Scenario 3 with system("/usr/bin/true") Command
Number of Test Iterations: 1,000
Average time: 3,011,890 ns

For Scenario 4 with Signal to Self
Number of Test Iterations: 1,000
Average time: 3,907 ns

For Scenario 5 with Round-Trip Signal Time
Number of Test Iterations: 2 (done manually)
Average time: 63,566 ns
